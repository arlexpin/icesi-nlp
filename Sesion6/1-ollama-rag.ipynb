Además de eso, exploraremos el uso de [Ollama](https://ollama.com) una librería de reciente salida que facilita enormemente el poder instalar y correr localmente grandes modelos de lenguaje como [Llama 3](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/) de Meta, el cual utilizarémos como motor de lenguaje base para crear un ChatBot conversacional adaptado al corpus de Wikihow en español.\n",

Por eso, es necesario partir los documentos en \"chunks\" de tal forma que al momento de hacer la búsqueda de documentos, no solo los documentos obtenidos quepan en el contexto del LLM, sino que pueda haber algo de diversidad.\n",

        "Hay diferentes estrategias para partir los documentos, una de ellas, como los autores del paper original de RAG, es partir los documentos por una cantidad de palabras fijas, e incluso podemos permitirnos que haya un solapamiento entre los documentos una vez partidos con el fin de que haya oportunidad de recuperar un contexto más global cuando la información relevante se expande por varias oraciones en el documento."

Esta operación, lo que hace es calcular la similitud entre dos textos, el query y los documentos, ambos proyectados en el espacio denso de los embeddings según el modelo que estemos usando. Recordemos que los embeddings semanticamente similares tienden a estar cercanos el uno del otro, por tanto, debería tener sentido obtener los documentos similares en función del producto punto entre el query y los documentos. Esto es justamente lo que hace el Document Retriever. Esto puede ser una red entrenable, justamente para mejorar la calidad de las representaciones de los embeddings y asi obtener mejores similitudes entre queries y documentos.\n",

        "- Los modelos de lenguaje tienden a ser estáticos, su conocimiento se limita a el corpus con los cuales fueron entrenados o hecho fine tuning. Esto presenta una limitante al momento de requerir información más actualizada puesto que el modelo no cuenta con mecanismos \"rápidos\" para hacerlo por si solo. Re-entrenar el modelo puede resultar costoso o inviable en algunos casos.\n",
        "- RAG es una popular técnica para dotar a estos modelos de cierto dinamismo y acceso a información más reciente que puede que no haya sido parte de su proceso de entrenamiento. El trabajo del modelo base es entonces el de generar secuencias coherentes de forma condicionada a un contexto que le estamos proveyendo a través de los documentos relevantes recuperados.\n",
        "- El hecho de poder separar la recuperación de la generación hace que sea mucho más factible la actualización de información del agente conversacional, ya no sería tan necesario re-entrenar el modelo base en si, sino el modelo de recuperación de documentos y/o su respectivo codificador. Esta es una tarea de significativo menor esfuerzo que re-entrenar el modelo base para muchos casos.\n",
        "- RAG no es perfecto, lo que estamos haciendo aquí es simplemente condicionar al modelo un poco más de lo que normalmente lo estaría, estos agentes realmnete NO están razonando ni planificando nada, simplemente estamos influyendo en las probabilidades del siguiente token de las secuencias que se generan. Además, si tenemos un buen retriever pero un mal modelo base, los resultados que podemos obtener no van a ser tan buenos de igual modo.\n",
        "- Esta implementación, si bien funciona relativamente bien, no entrena un Document Retriever, por lo que las similitudes de documentos y queries podrían ser mejores, dando lugar a una mejor calidad de resultado conversacional.\n",
        "- Asimismo, en cuanto a los datos, cada escenario puede ser diferente y merezca ser atentido de forma particular, por ejemplo la partición de documentos puede seguir estrategias diferentes, como un chunk size mayor o menor, con o sin solapamiento. Estos hyper-parámetros tienen un efecto en la calidad de los resultados del modelo y deben ser explorados en función del caso de uso."
